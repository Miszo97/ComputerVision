# ComputerVision
Neural network application for image classification. 

The idea is to use web application to let users draw digital numbers which can be later 
recognized by a neural network. The outcome is then returned to a user.

We can consider the whole project to be composed of two layers. 
- Frontend layer (Django application)
- Backend layer (machine learning algorithms)
